# Bomberman

This little Game was created in our free time of a programming boocamp lectured by academiadecodigo.org,
after less than one month learning Java.

We had one week and could only work on the project after the class hours (after 7 pm).
The goal was to improve our team skills in a stressfull environment.
The main rule was:
We could only use the SimpleGraphics library to create the animations.

There are a few bugs along the code, and it might look a little messy to trained eyes, but keep in mind this was all achieved at an early stage of the bootcamp.

Thanks to our Master Coders.

The team:
César Cota && Rodrigo Borba && Soraia Veríssimo && João Silva
